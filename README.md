# Weather-or-not. 
A weather dashboard (in progress)

An app for travelers who want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that they can plan a trip accordingly.

## Description

This is a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city.

## Usage
 When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed.

 When a user views future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed.
